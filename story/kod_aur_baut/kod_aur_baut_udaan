this tale was told to me by my grandfathers. It was  when we used to visit him
at his home, deep into the mountains of garhwal during summer. in the breezy
evening air of the mountains, as we sat on flat piece of land, at the hilltop.


He spoke to us(brothers) of the tale of kod aur baut, two demigods who changed
this hostile land into a playsport of ours.

There was a race which at  a point of time, on this planet, held the most 
dominant biological revolution to bring about a meaning of life. llll was not
wrong when he said that we are a 3 dimensional simulation in a fourth 
dimensionable race!
