this tale was told to me by my grandfathers. It was  when we used to visit him
at his home, deep into the mountains of garhwal during summer. in the breezy
evening air of the mountains, as we sat on flat piece of land, at the hilltop.


He spoke to us(brothers) of the tale of kod aur baut, two demigods who changed
this hostile land into a playsport for generations to come.

There was a race which at  a point of time, on this planet, held the most 
dominant biological revolution to bring about a meaning of life. llll was not
wrong when he said that we are a 3 dimensional simulation in a fourth 
dimensionable race!




What is the book about?

characters, protagonists, premise, writing style?


premise and protag with style




 two brothers: kod and baut. They live high up in himalayas.one day kod gets swept away
in currents of ganges.The story progresses in the evolution of kod(which in a way reflects
our current techonological journey). the culmination of the story is meeting of kod and
baut eventually where setup of baut's story(a leap into what humanity can transcend to,the
future if you will) takes place. This can be explored in detail in the second part if 
needed. 

 

So, rest of the details can be piled up! What I would like to write about is an allegory
of our present technological world. I would like to present this in a writing style 
comprehensively complementing this. What kind of evolution would this be, I would need to
explore.

Now coming to the main part. The story of kod. This would drive the whole tale. 
The character and it's journey! Specifics of the character. What drives it? What is it 
about? What makes it? Chetna!!
