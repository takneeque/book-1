camus and the tales of neitzsche


 It was without the parlance of tragic fate that you had to leave. That
night, beset in it's festive and spirited longing, yielded a trueness on my 
face, a face brazen upon the convention of moribund society.A soul rising and
emphatic, full of zest, looking to bring forth a true sense of life, an
outcome of living voraciously.  


--------------------------------


Dangled and dejected

in pristine lands of withered
would be found a rustic pot
A jewel

why? because life is beautiful in all it's complicity and complications.
It is at the same time almost like the sun in the spring or hailstorms on the
winter. what must become of the tragic life that is suffered by all of us? we
must persevere and survive to find the why? This beauty found in our eyes is
what shall make us the most exhilerated and composed simultaneously! It should
be without any complications that we should be able to find meaning in chaos!

again! why? why to all the trecheries we face in this daunting eclipse of life
and why must we perfunctorily live out the ragged change of time assigned to
us. it would be of no sanity and of no consequece that I would have to live
further down the stream of undulated life! Oh! but when is this life straight-
forward! would it be uncompromised to realise that in these bizarre compunctions
of life, we negotiate a fair weather scrupled thesis. I would deny beyond my
last remaining pieces of entwined guts, a fall to the abyss of unnamed 
nothingness. To live without reason and without the choice..to exist falisfying
the edicts of surefootedness,
