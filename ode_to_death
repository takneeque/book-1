 I must bring forward this piece. It would be my last attempt to do so. I am losing myself
with each day,slowly but surely, weaning away from the modicum of life left in me. A life,
which is surely worth living and unbeknownst to conscious me, subtley but surely prances 
away from me. As I find myself, a tether of this moment, these thoughts making me, I can but
only humbly accept my omissions which have lead me to this fag end of my drive. For my will
is the fashion of life, without which I may as well be a shrub. I write to relive all those
memories which had hitherto been alive on this cosmic spectacle through me. 

May I find solace in the pretence of a life as I have lived thus far. before that though, here
are the details.
